if we have 3 workernodes namely workernode1, workernode2, workernode3
Before applying the taint and toleration u have one pode namely pod1 running on workernode1 then u apply taint and toleration to the node1
then it will evict all the pods that doesnt matches the toleration (it will evict the pod1)


âœ… Pod Definition File with Toleration
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-toleration1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "node"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "mynode1"
    effect: "NoExecute"
