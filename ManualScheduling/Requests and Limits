Dveloper created one application he mentions  and how much memory 

ðŸ“š Binary vs Decimal Units
There are two systems used for measuring digital storage:

Type	Name	Based on	Multiplier	Abbreviation
Binary	Kibibyte	Powers of 2	1 KiB = 1024 B	KiB
Mebibyte		1 MiB = 1024 KiB = 1,048,576 B	MiB
Gibibyte		1 GiB = 1024 MiB = 1,073,741,824 B	GiB
Decimal	Kilobyte	Powers of 10	1 KB = 1000 B	KB
Megabyte		1 MB = 1000 KB = 1,000,000 B	MB
Gigabyte		1 GB = 1000 MB = 1,000,000,000 B	GB

1 GiB â‰ˆ 1.074 GB

1 MiB â‰ˆ 1.048 MB

1 KiB â‰ˆ 1.024 KB

ðŸ›  Why does Kubernetes use MiB, GiB?
Kubernetes, like Linux, uses binary units to be precise. If it says 1Gi, it really means 1024 Ã— 1024 Ã— 1024 bytes, not 1 billion bytes. This avoids ambiguity.




ðŸ§  How it works:
Kubernetes measures CPU in millicores:

1000m = 1000 millicores = 1 full CPU core

500m = 0.5 core

250m = 0.25 core

âœ… Examples:
yaml
Copy
Edit
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"    # Half a core
  limits:
    cpu: "1000m"   # One full core
You can also write:

yaml
Copy
Edit
cpu: "1"   # This is the same as 1000m
